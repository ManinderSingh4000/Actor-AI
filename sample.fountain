INT. SMALL ROADSIDE STORE – LATE AFTERNOON

The store is quiet. A ceiling fan hums.

The SHOPKEEPER counts change behind the counter.

The STRANGER stands nearby, examining a candy bar. He sets it down.

STRANGER
How long you been running this place?

SHOPKEEPER
Oh—
close to thirty years now.

The STRANGER nods. Processes this.

STRANGER
That’s a long time.

SHOPKEEPER
(smiles)
Guess it is.

A beat.

The STRANGER looks around.

STRANGER
Place doesn’t change much, does it?

SHOPKEEPER
People like it that way.

The STRANGER meets his eyes.

STRANGER
You married?

SHOPKEEPER
Yes, sir.

STRANGER
How long?

SHOPKEEPER
Thirty-two years.

The STRANGER tilts his head slightly.

STRANGER
Then you know something about commitment.

The SHOPKEEPER chuckles politely.

SHOPKEEPER
I suppose.

Silence stretches.

The STRANGER takes a coin from his pocket and places it on the counter.

STRANGER
You ever notice how some things only look small
until they decide something big?

The SHOPKEEPER glances at the coin.

SHOPKEEPER
I’m not sure what you mean.

STRANGER
That coin’s been traveling a long time.
Long before either of us walked in here.

He nudges it forward.

STRANGER (CONT’D)
Call it.

The SHOPKEEPER frowns.

SHOPKEEPER
Call what?

STRANGER
Heads or tails.

SHOPKEEPER
(confused, uneasy)
For what?

The STRANGER’s voice stays calm.

STRANGER
For everything up to this moment.

A long pause. The fan hum grows louder.

SHOPKEEPER
I didn’t agree to any game.

STRANGER
That’s the thing.
You don’t have to agree for it to matter.

The SHOPKEEPER swallows.

SHOPKEEPER
Heads.

The STRANGER flips the coin. Catches it. Covers it.

He reveals it.

STRANGER
You chose right.

The SHOPKEEPER exhales, nervous laugh.

SHOPKEEPER
So… what happens now?

The STRANGER pushes the coin toward him.

STRANGER
You keep it.

SHOPKEEPER
Why?

The STRANGER leans in just slightly.

STRANGER
Because you won.
And people should remember
when luck decided to stay.

The STRANGER turns and walks out.

The SHOPKEEPER stares at the coin in his hand.

The bell over the door jingles.

Silence.

CUT TO BLACK.
